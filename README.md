- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bearinwoods
- 👀 I’m a Project Operations and Brand Analyst with a passion for Food Management software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL and interlinking JASON, XML.
- 💞️ I’m persuing going further into Python and learning the different libraries and basic SQL functionality.
- 📫 How to reach me: jberoset@live.com.
- I spent a year developing a Food Costing platform called OneSlice. The original intent was an inexpensive portal for 'mom n pop' level restaurants to help them acheive recipe and plate building capabilities. I have tons of Excel and Access VBA code all centered around the userform experience and breaking apart food costs, recipes and purchasing analysis.
- Development stopped when I started working for Artisanal Brewing Ventures. I implimented their Compeat Advantage platform, which allowed me to work with true 'commercial' level food costing software.
- My dream has never died though... I would love to pitch my OneSlice concept to AWS and create a simple interactive platform for all the great small level restauraunts out there.
